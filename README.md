# Hi, I'm Nana!

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Germany with a love for visual design

<ul>
<li>🏡 Frontend is where my home and heart is at, but I do love me a well-engineered backend
<li>🏕️ I'm not afraid to set up a tent on the server side of things, too!
<li>🧹 If you notice that someone reorganised, sectioned and commented your code, it was most likely me
<li>🌝 Notoriously known for never sleeping (learning and creating things is just too exciting!)
</ul>
