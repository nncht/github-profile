# Hi, I'm Nana!

---

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Germany with a love for visual design
🏡 Frontend is where my home and heart is at, but I do love me a well-engineered backend
🏕️ I'm not afraid to set up a tent on the server side of things, too!
🧹 If you notice that someone reorganised, sectioned and commented your code, 99% of the time it was me
🌝 Notoriously known for never sleeping (learning and creating things is just too exciting!)
